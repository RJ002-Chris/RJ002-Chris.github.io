                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Roosevelt is a neighborhood located in Northeast
                            Seattle and is known for its diverse and socially active community that serves as a
                            transportation and commercial hub. If the name of this neighborhood sounded familiar, that
                            is because President Roosevelt grew very fond of this neighborhood and since his death in
                            1919, the local community remembered his Seattle visits, as well as his effort to preserve
                            much of the neighborhood’s nature and beauty so after a naming contest in 1927, the place
                            was officially named “Roosevelt Neighborhood”. Since then, the neighborhood has maintained
                            its natural beauty. Being able to experience nature while enjoying a nice cup of coffee in
                            the Roosevelt neighborhood has never been easier as the neighborhood boasts more than 15
                            cafes in that area alone, ranging from franchise cafes to local-owned roasteries. As a
                            coffee enjoyer myself, this made me want to explore the wide range of cafes in the
                            neighborhood and see whether the culture and history here has given their coffee here a
                            unique scent.</p>

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">During our field scouting of the Roosevelt
                            Neighborhood, we noticed several coffee shops around the area as every corner we made, there
                            would be one. Since Seattle is known as the birthplace of Starbucks and is the city where
                            coffee has turned from a daily necessity to a form of art, we decided to look at coffee
                            shops in Roosevelt Neighborhood and see what past customers had to say in general about the
                            coffee scene here. In this project we used a 
                            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p7iOEefWETyoUHPqRtYnXBRtkKuCsug_?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                             made by Yifan to retrieve several café reviews from Yelp. We then compiled the comments and chose 15 cafes for this
                            project. We then cleaned out the extra reviews and the comments before converting it into a

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Looking at the radial dendrogram, we can see that most
                            of the comments were positive comments, either complimenting the coffee or the café design,
                            with a few negative comments describing the bad coffee they tasted, or one such comment that
                            said “greedy”. Some of the comments also describe the experience of the café itself. The
                            variance in comments regarding whether they enjoyed the coffee or not could be explained by
                            the wide range of coffee available, such as espressos, cappuccinos, lattes, americanos, or
                            other new types of coffees. Many different factors go into producing the coffee and the
                            resulting taste, from the bean the café uses to the method of brewing and style of coffee.
                            Each person also has their own personal tastes so not everyone will have the same thoughts
                            on the same coffee. This is why although there are various opinions about the cafes as seen
                            on yelp, I would still recommend people going in person to try them out as it may fit their
                            taste better. The comments aside, it was interesting to see the different opinions people
                            had on cafes and made me want to go out to try them all.

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">I personally have only been to Roosevelt Neighborhood
                            once and remember trying one of the coffee shops there. It was a nice and quiet neighborhood
                            to peacefully enjoy some coffee. During the field scouting for this project, while taking
                            photos to create a sketch, I remembered my past experiences and decided to try a different
                            coffee shop. This was when I got the idea of café reviews, as I was also curious to see what
                            people had to say about the coffee in this neighborhood. Me and my group mate’s role were
                            essentially the same for this project as we both went on a scouting trip at our own
                            conveniences, as well as helped each other work on the radial dendrogram. I felt that even
                            if we didn’t get to meet up and discuss together, since we both did our jobs and
                            communicated to each other about what we had to do, we were able to get the assignment done
                            swiftly.
                        </p>
                    </br>
                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Since the cafes represented in the infographic are
                                ones that we chose and the
                            comments are only the ones from yelp, the dendrogram somewhat represents what people think
                            about cafes in the Roosevelt Neighborhood. The coffee scene is also very big in Seattle
                            which contributed to choosing this topic. Creating the radial dendrogram wasn’t that
                            complicated as the instructions were easy to follow. As for improvements, if we had more
                            time we would have liked to try and gather more comments for each café to give the radial
                            dendrogram more variance.
