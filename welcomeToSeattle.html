                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Alaska Airlines was founded in 1932 in Anchorage, AK,
                            but after 2 decades of operations, they decided to move their headquarters to Paine Field,
                            an airport north of Seattle. So, despite its name, Alaska airlines have been operating in
                            Seattle for the past 7 decades, now flying to more than 120 destinations in five countries.
                            Alaska airlines and their robust number of flights has allowed for more direct flight routes
                            to and from Seattle. With the increasing popularity, the city of Seattle has also seen an
                            increase in number of flights to Seattle, with Seattle ranking at number 15 on most popular
                            US cities (YouGov, 2023), and the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport sitting just outside
                            the top 10 busiest US airports, ranking in at number 11. (Mala, 2024) With this in mind, we
                            wanted to find out the top 10 airports in the US with the most flights from
                            Seattle flown by Alaska airlines.</p>

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The data was collected from <a
                                href="https://openflights.org/#">Open Flights</a>, a website
                            that displays route maps for almost every airplane and airport in the world.
                            After filtering to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and only Alaska Airlines
                            flights, we were able to download the dataset from the website. We then collaborated through
                            a 
                            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/146fw5Y_el4zTmCGzU8fyAlnSzJcJ2R5N?usp=sharing"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                google collab file
                            </a>
                            , filtering the dataset to only the
                            data we need. We then created a Sankey Diagram using the plotly library,
                            presenting the top 10 most popular destinations flown by Alaska Airlines.
                            We then added a legend using different colors to differentiate the various states,
                            as well as set the distance to each node according to the distance between Seattle and the destination in real life.
                            Since there were some nodes with the same number of planes, we figured that having the reader be able to
                            differentiate the lengths of the node was important. From the chart we can effectively
                            observe the top destinations on the list. Most of the destinations were within California,
                            which is very close to Seattle, but the destination with the most flights is Anchorage,
                            Alaska. This result was not surprising as Anchorage is the original city Alaska Airlines was
                            founded in, and California is right below Seattle.

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Our process of analyzing and producing the
                            visualization has allowed us to explore more about what destinations are most popular from
                            Seattle, which might be supported by Alaska airlines have more planes available to fly you
                            to that destination. Although having moved their headquarters from Anchorage to Seattle,
                            they still maintain a strong connection with lots of flights available. As one of the major
                            airlines in the pacific northwest, the increasing popularity of Seattle will also help the
                            airline business grow, which could result in more flights soon. If we were to collect
                            information and make this infographic again the same time next year, we could definitely see
                            big changes to the infographic.

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The process of finding information definitely shaped
                            our topic, as we took quite a bit of time to find enough information to be able to use for
                            our lab assignment. Communicating between group members was not an issue as we communicated
                            effectively through discord. Even if members did not attend section, those who did filled
                            them in on what they missed, or discussion we held about our project. Coding was also not an
                            issue as everyone on our team could help if they needed. My role in this project was the
                            Data Visualizer and I think I did well. Although creating a Sankey Diagram was new to me, I
                            could easily search up the plotly library and learn how to set parameters for the diagram.
                            My goal for the next project is to be able to choose a topic we really like and find the
                            information we need rather than selecting our topic based on the data available to us.
                            Once again thanks to my great team for working together to create the wonderful infographic.</p>
